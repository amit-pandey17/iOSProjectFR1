## Fetch Rewards iOS exercise.

###In this iOS assignment, I have created the application to fetch the API from Seatgeek website.
1. For this, I generated the client ID as directed in the seatgeek API documentation
2. I could succesfully hit the URL with client ID and I got the JSON data
3. I modelled the incoming data in such a way that I get the desired output
4. This is a nested JSON and hence it took some effort to decode it and model it as received.
5. Although this is still in development stage, I didn't want to take much time and I am uploading it as far as I could go. 
6. I have followed the MVC pattern in this assignment
